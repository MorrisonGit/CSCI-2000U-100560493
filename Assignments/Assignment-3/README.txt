1. Received help from a friend for question 1 in relation to getting the 
   correct output.

2. Had to look at an online guide to retrieve temperatures from the files in question 3.
   So I'm still not too familiar with "with open... as..." command.

3. Got help from a friend to split the values in question 4. 
   And later on when encountering troubles with boolean values.
